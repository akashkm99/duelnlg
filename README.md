## Installation
From Source:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akashkm99/duelnlg.git
cd duelnlg
pip install -e .
```
To use automatic metrics, you may also need to download nlgeval data:
```bash
python ./scripts/download/nlg-eval --setup
```

## Experiments from Paper
Here, we describe the steps to replicate the experiments mentioned in the paper. 

### Download and Prepare Data
To download and preprocess the WMT 2016 datasets:
```bash
bash scripts/preprocess/wmt16.sh
```
All the processed data will be stored as .pkl files at ```data/wmt16/processed/```

For the WMT 2015 datasets, 
```bash
bash scripts/preprocess/wmt15.sh
```
### Model Free Algorithms

To perform experiments with model-free dueling bandits algorithms, use the ```duelnlg/duelpy/experiments/experiments.py``` script. It has the following arguments:

* `--feedback-config`: A json config that specifies the list of datasets and their parameters. Use ```configs/feedback/wmt_all.json``` to run on all 7 WMT datasets.
* `--algorithm-config`: Config file that specifies the dueling bandit algorithms and their parameters. Use ```configs/algorithm/rmed.json``` to run the RMED algorithm and refer to ```configs/algorithm/default_all.json``` for the default parameters for all algorithms.
* `--output-dir`: Directory to save the results. (Default: ./results/bandits) 
* `--num-runs`: The number of times each algorithm is run with different random seed (Default: 200) 
* `--random-seed`: The base random seed to use (Default: 42)

For example, to run all the dueling bandits algorithm (except: IF and PL which are quite slow) on the WMT 2016 tur->eng dataset with 50 runs use:
```bash
python duelnlg/duelpy/experiments/experiments.py \
          --feedback-config ./configs/feedback/wmt16_tur_eng.json \
          --algorithm-config ./configs/algorithm/default_all_no_if_pl.json \
          --num-runs 50 
```

### Model Based Algorithms 

#### 1. Download Training and Validation Data

To use direct evaluation metrics, we need to tune a few hyperparameters (e.g. thresholds for the preference probabilities) on a validation set. For training any end-to-end metric for pairwise prediction, we would also require a training set. 

To create the train and validation datasets for WMT, we use data from WMT 2013 and 2014:
```
bash scripts/prepare_train_val/wmt.sh
```
#### 2. Automatic Evaluation Metrics

To run the Bleurt model, you need to download the model checkpoint:

```bash
bash scripts/download/bleurt_ckpt.sh
```

To run automatic metrics and save the predictions, use the ```duelnlg/direct_eval/evaluation.py``` script. It has the following arguments:

* `--metrics-config`: A json config that specifies the list of automatic metrics and their parameters. Use `configs/metrics/bleurt.json` to use bleurt and refer to `configs/metrics/all.json` to run all metrics. 
* `--val-path` and `test-path`: CSV files with the validation (for tuning) and test datasets.  E.g. for WMT 2016, it's `./data/wmt13_14/processed/val.csv` and `data/wmt16/processed/wmt16-human-judgements.csv` respectively. 
* `--processed-dir`: Directory with the processed .pkl files. E.g. for WMT 2016, it's `data/wmt16/processed`
* `--ensemble`: Whether to perform mulitple model forward passes with dropout for uncertainity estimation. Applicable only for Bleurt (Default: False) 
* `--multiref`: Whether the dataset has multiple reference texts. (Default: True)

For example, to run the Bleurt metric on WMT 2016 datasets, use the following:
```bash
python duelnlg/direct_eval/evaluation.py \
          --metrics ./configs/metrics/bleurt.json \
          --val-path ./data/wmt13_14/processed/val.csv \
          --test-path ./data/wmt16/processed/wmt16-human-judgements.csv \
          --output-results ./results/metrics/bleurt.csv \
          --processed-dir ./data/wmt16/processed
```

##### Note:
* Use GPUs to speedup the evaluation. If GPUs are not being used, please check your tensorflow version and CUDA compatibility. (Install a tf (>2.0) version that supports your CUDA version). 

* To accelerate your evaluation with Google Cloud TPUs, refer to `configs/metrics/bleurt_tpu.json`. You just need to provide information on your storage bucket & TPU. 

##### Uncertainity Estimation:

To compute uncertainity in the Bleurt scores (required for Uncertainity-aware selection and UCB elimination algos), use the following:
```bash
python duelnlg/direct_eval/evaluation.py \
        --metrics ./configs/metrics/bleurt_ensemble.json \
        --val-path ./data/wmt13_14/processed/val_1k.csv \
        --test-path ./data/wmt16/processed/wmt16-human-judgements.csv \
        --output-results ./results/metrics/bleurt_ensemble.csv \
        --processed-dir ./data/wmt16/processed \
        --ensemble
```

#### 3. Model Based Dueling Bandits 

Once you've computed the automatic metric predictions, you can run model-based algorithms by simply adding the flag `--model-config` to your `duelnlg/duelpy/experiments/experiments.py` script. 

For example to perform random mixing with Bleurt using RMED on the WMT16 tur->eng dataset, use

```bash
python duelnlg/duelpy/experiments/experiments.py \
          --model-config ./configs/models/random_mixing_blerut.json
          --feedback-config ./configs/feedback/wmt16_tur_eng.json \
          --algorithm-config ./configs/algorithm/rmed.json \
          --num-runs 200 
```

For other model-based algorithms, you can use the following model configs:


| Algorithm                           | Config                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Random Mixing                       | `./configs/models/random_mixing_bleurt`                     |
| Uncertainity-aware Selection (BALD) | `./configs/models/uncertainity_bleurt.json`                 |
| UCB Elimination                     | `./configs/models/ucb_elimination_bleurt.json`              |
| Uncertainity + UCB Elimination      | `./configs/models/uncertainity_ucb_elimination_bleurt.json` |
